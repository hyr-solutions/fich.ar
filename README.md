Build modern forms
without ever leaving your HTML.

Powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
# Start Vite's dev server
pnpm dev

# ...and start Pocketbase!
pnpm pocketbase

# ...and start an agent-endpoint!
pnpm ngrok
```

And then and only then, you will be able to develop!

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
